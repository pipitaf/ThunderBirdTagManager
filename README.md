Basically it works by having a .txt file in the same folder as the .py then editing the .txt with these parameters

user_pref("mailnews.tags.$label1.color", "#e31414");
user_pref("mailnews.tags.$label1.tag", "example");

Per entry you make you gotta change the label numbers

I'll try to develop another tool that will manage this .txt so it doesn't have to be so manual.
